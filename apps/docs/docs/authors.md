# Authors

The Authors page lets you browse every author in your library, view their portrait and biography sourced from Open Library, and see which books you own by them.

## Browsing Authors

![Authors page](../static/screenshots/authors.png)

Navigate to **Authors** in the sidebar to open the author list. Authors are shown alphabetically with a portrait photo (when available) and a book count.

Use the **filter field** at the top to narrow the list by name — filtering is instant and works case-insensitively.

Clicking an author card opens the **Author Detail** panel, which shows:

- Portrait photo or a placeholder avatar
- Biography (when available)
- A **View on Goodreads** link, if a Goodreads ID has been resolved
- All books in your library by that author — click any book to open its detail view

## Author Data Enrichment

Litara can automatically fetch author portraits, biographies, and Goodreads IDs from [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org). Enrichment matches authors by exact name and downloads all available data in one pass.

:::note Admin only
Enrichment is available to admin users only.

### Enriching a single author

1. Open the **Author Detail** panel by clicking the author's card.
2. Click **Enrich Author Data**.
3. A toast notification confirms the result — green if a photo was found, yellow if no photo was available (biography and Goodreads ID may still have been updated).

Re-running enrichment always uses `force=true`, so it overwrites any previously stored data.

### Enriching all authors at once

1. Go to **Admin Settings → Metadata**.
2. Scroll to the **Author Data Enrichment** section.
3. Click **Enrich All Author Data**.

This kicks off a background task that works through every author missing a photo, biography, or Goodreads ID. Progress is visible in the **Tasks** tab. The task applies a 200 ms delay between authors to respect Open Library's rate limits.

To re-enrich authors that already have data, use the per-author button in the Author Detail panel with the force option.

## Mobile

The Authors list is also available in the mobile app via the **Authors** entry in the side drawer. Tap an author to see their books. Portrait photos and biographies are shown when available; there is no enrichment option in the mobile app.
